                        <td>Junichi Masuda</td>
                        <td>Minako Adachi</td>
                        <td>When I first heard this theme, I was impressed by how cinematic it sounds. Even more
                            impressive is how this theme is dynamic; "Cabo Poco" plays when the player is outside within
                            the town, while "Home" plays while they're in theirs or Nemona's house. The primary
                            difference between these themes is the inclusion of a marching drum track in "Cabo Poco",
                            which gives the theme more of a lively quality compared to "Home"... suiting for the fact
                            that it plays when the player is outside! This theme has definitely grown to become one of
                            my favourite "hometown" themes in the Pokémon series.</td>

                        <td>Minako Adachi</td>
                        <td>There is a beautiful use of the oboe and piano in this theme, which I love. The theme also
                            features use of glockenspiel, alto saxophone, and a brass section. For a theme that plays
                            while the player is walking around in Paldea's biggest city, this theme certainly is very
                            well composed!</td>
                        <td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySVGelSoHFA" target="_blank">Mesagoza</a></td>

                        <td>Minako Adachi</td>
                        <td>This is a neat little addition to the soundtrack. In the city of Mesagoza, the player will
                            find a guitarist performing. Should the player stand in proximity of this guitarist, the
                            Mesagoza theme will dynamically transition into a guitar rendition of the theme! This is
                            amazing environmental sound design!</td>
                        <td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj0dr9bFYw0" target="_blank">One Song in Mesagoza,

                        <td>Minako Adachi</td>
                        <td>Gosh... Where do I begin with this theme. There's been a lot of mixed reception for this
                            theme,
                            but personally I think it's amazing! The way it dynamically progresses as the battle against
                            the gym leader progresses... just wow.<br><br>Beginning with a feature of Junichi Masuda's
                            "Gym"
                            motif from Pokémon Red and Green, and then transitioning into a big band-esque theme as the
                            gym leader sends out their first Pokémon, this theme does not disappoint! Every time the gym
                            leader sends out a new pokémon, the track gets more and more intense.<br><br> With the first
                            Pokémon
                            being sent into battle, the track only consists of an intense bassline, drum pattern, short
                            brass
                            stabs, and synth arps to fill in the gaps. Upon release of the gym leader's second Pokémon
                            into battle,
                            a more intense synth track is added in among the existing tracks. It is when the gym leader
                            releases their third pokémon where the track gets even more interesting. The brass section
                            is now no longer just playing stabs, instead playing full-on phrases, essentially being a
                            melody
                            line at this point.<br><br> The true climax is reached when the gym-leader releases their
                            final
                            Pokémon, and proceeds to Terastalize them. If the gym-leader has a bit of dialogue before
                            they Terastalize their Pokémon (looking at you Larry hehe), then the theme will initially
                            transition to a a version that only features the drum pattern and the bassline. Upon the
                            beginning of the Terastalization cutscene, the music starts to get even more intense, as the
                            brass play multiple phrases to help establish a key change (Eb Minor to Gb Major).<br><br>
                            Upon
                            the
                            end of this cutscene, the theme is now extremely cheerful and upbeat, with a choir joining
                            in to sing a chant. This is an effective way of getting the player pumped up and determined
                            to defeat the gym leader's final Pokémon. It is here where I must unfortunately state my
                            only problem with this theme. The part of the theme that plays when battling the gym
                            leader's terastalized Pokémon, is designed to dynamically transition to the "Victory! (Gym
                            Leader)" theme, upon defeat of the gym leader's last Pokémon. My problem with this lies in
                            the fact that out of the two points in the theme where the dynamic transition could happen,
                            only one of them will lead to a natural sounding transition. The other transition sounds
                            rather abrupt. But with that being said, this doesn't at all affect the theme's overall
                            merit... you just gotta time your battle right in such a way that you defeat the gym
                            leader's terastalized Pokémon at JUST the right time for the theme to transition to
                            "Victory! (Gym Leader)". <br><br>Overall this is such an amazing theme, and Minako Adachi
                            deserves all the
                            praise she can get for this masterpiece!</td>
                        <td>No link unforunately! None of the youtube uploads of this theme have properly alligned the
                            various phrases of this theme.</td>
                        </td>
